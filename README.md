# Project Overview(omar faruk)

This project showcases a dynamic and interactive web application built using core React fundamentals. It focuses on efficient state management and smooth navigation to provide a seamless user experience.

## Key React Fundamentals Used
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The project is built using a modular approach, with reusable components for scalability and maintainability.
- **React Router**: Enables dynamic, client-side routing for an SPA (Single Page Application) experience without page reloads.
- **Context API**: Provides a centralized state management solution for data across multiple components, allowing for easy state sharing and management.
- **Hooks**: Utilizes React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useParams` for state management, lifecycle handling, and accessing route parameters.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implements dynamic rendering of components based on user actions and application state.

## Data Handling & Management
- **Context API**: Used to manage and share the cart and wishlist states across components, avoiding the need for prop drilling.
- **Local Storage**: Stores persistent data, such as user preferences, so that user interactions are remembered even after refreshing the page.

## Project Features
1. **Add to Cart & Wishlist with Toast Notifications**: Users can add products to the cart or wishlist with a toast message confirming the action.
2. **Dynamic Page Titles**: The title updates based on the active route, enhancing usability.
3. **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
4. **Product Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort products by price and filter by category, enhancing product discovery.
5. **Interactive Product Details Page**: Detailed views for each product, including specifications, ratings, and user reviews, accessible without page reloads.
